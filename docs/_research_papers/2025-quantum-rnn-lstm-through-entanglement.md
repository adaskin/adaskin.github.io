abstract: "In this paper, we discuss how quantum recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their enhanced version, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can be modeled using the core ideas presented by Linden et al., where the entangling and disentangling power of unitary transformations is investigated. In particular, we interpret entangling and disentangling power as information retention and forgetting mechanisms in LSTMs. Therefore, entanglement becomes a key component of the optimization (training) process. We believe that, by leveraging prior knowledge of the entangling power of unitaries, the proposed quantum-classical framework can guide and help to design  better-parameterized quantum circuits for various real-world applications."
