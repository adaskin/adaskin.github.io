    - **Explaination and highlight:** To find a marked element in database, the Grover search algorithm is implemented by following Gram-Schmidt process and using a single non-unitary gate. 
    In some cases, the marked element in $N=2^n$ items can be obtained with O(n) repetitions, 
    where n is the number of qubits.
