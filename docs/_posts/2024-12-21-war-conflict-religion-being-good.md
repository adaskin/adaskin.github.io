While looking at the events happening in the region, as a muslim I often seek guidence from Quran. While reading I came across the following verses:

- 2-122. O Children of Israel! Remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the nations. 
- 2-123. And fear the Day (of Judgement) when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use ot him, nor shall they be helped. 
- 2-124. And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim (Abraham) tried him with (certain) commands, which he fulfiled. He (Allah) said (to him), "Verily, I am going to make you an Imam (a leader) for mankind (to follow you)." (Ibrahim) said "And of my offspring to make  leaders." Allah said, "My covenant (prophethood) includes not Zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers)."

Reading these verses make me think the decendants of Abraham: Isaac, Ishmael(Ismail), Isaac(Ishak), David (Davud), Solomon (Suleiman), Moses (Musa), Mariam, Jesus (Isa), Muhammad (yes, Arabs also descendants of Abraham!) peace be upon them.
As said in the verses, Allah made them leaders(role models) to the people. 
To be included in this covenant and  Abraham's prayers mentioned in different verses, we, muslims, say we are of Abraham's nation. 

Then, I started thinking  the meaning of being preferred by God and the responsibility that comes with it.
How should someone being preferred by God behave? 
- like a spoiled child or an arrogant bully... (obviously those prophets was not any of these)
- more humble, doing more good than others, being better than others, more descent...

I think the answer is  obvious. If we want to be included in this covenant, first we should start with not having the feeling (or at least having decency to not say) that we are chosen and somehow above any other human being because at the end of the verse Allah clearly says those who are unjust are not included in this covenant and Abraham's prayers. So instead of making meaningless arguments, we should try to correct our actions and try to refrain from being unjust and a wrongdoer as much as we can...
