After using DeepSeek for **free** and seeing all the hype and the worries of big companies, I have to say I am feeling a little happy.
I think opensource and openscience communities-whose code and books&research papers used to train tools that are closed and very expensive for the most of the world-have taken their revenge by DeepSeek.

The reasoning steps/thoughts in DeepSeek R1 reminds me of a very inteligient librarian in light novels who may be just a very small step short to become a famous inventor/innovator/thinker.
It can review most topics better than most review articles and with a little push it gives briliant concepts for future research directions.

For the system programming course next semester, it has given me a lot of good suggestions for how to integrate DeepSeek into the teaching ([see example prompts in syllabus](https://github.com/adaskin/bil222-sysprog25?tab=readme-ov-file#use-of-ai-gpt-gemini-deepseek-etc)). For now, I am not sure how these tools can be employed in learning and teaching without restraining youth potential or if it would be beneficial. But, I am happy that it is free and everybody can access this without paying $200 a month.

Next, I am waiting for advanced chips from China...
