# Summary
I am a researcher in the field of quantum computation, information and algorithms, as well as their applications in data science, bioinformatics and chemistry.  I have worked on various topics like finding numerical methods and matrix algorithms for optimally mapping computations to quantum circuits, designing quantum algorithms for matrix computations and optimization, designing algorithms for processing high dimensional data on quantum computers and testing and optimizing quantum machine learning models for near term quantum computers and their applications to data science problems.
